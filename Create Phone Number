Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example
create_phone_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) # => returns "(123) 456-7890"
The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.

Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!


my answer
def create_phone_number(n):
    first_three_numbers = ''.join(map(str, n[:3]))
    second_three_numbers = ''.join(map(str, n[3:6]))
    last_numbers = ''.join(map(str,n[6:10]))
    return f"({first_three_numbers}) {second_three_numbers}-{last_numbers}"
